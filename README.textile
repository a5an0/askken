h1. ASK KEN™ - Visual Knowledge Browser

"ASK KEN™":http://askken.heroku.com is some sort of a Node-Link diagram that allows to visually navigate through interconnected topics provided by "Freebase":http://www.freebase.com.

It uses "Rails":http://rubyonrails.org and the "Ken Ruby Freebase API Wrapper":http://github.com/michael/ken in the backend and "Processing.js":http://processingjs.org on front.

Using the new canvas element for drawing ASK KEN™ takes advantage of the latest HTML5 features.

Although it's basically working the project is far from being complete. Originally, it was just an attempt to build something useful on top of the Ken Freebase Library. ;)

Anyway, I hope you like it! 

Please feel free to check out the code and share your ideas! :)
